# Apache Sling Scripting HTL Integration Tests Content

This module is part of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project.

The embedded `org.apache.sling.scripting.sightly.testing-content-crlf` JAR provides testing content for [SLING-5543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-5543) which can not be easily saved into
SCM in a reliable way so that line endings are maintained without alteration.
